I want to start patching up some holes in my education that I couldn't manage to fill during my years at uni, so I decided to start with compilers and language design.

For now I'm just following a tutorial of sorts, using Bob Nystrom's Crafting Interpreters* to create an interpreter in java for a language called lox. I don't think it'll end up much more spectacular than a faithful reconstruction of what he outlines in the book, but I may take some creative liberties.
